### What I learned

Building by using the "mobile first" approach isn't as intimidating as I thought. Just keep in mind when to use min-width or max-width.

A great article on that: [Media Queries in CSS â€“ Min-Width and Max-Width](https://coderjony.com/blogs/media-queries-in-css-min-width-and-max-width/).

**TL;DR**. If you are going **mobile-first** you are going to be using a lot of **min-width**.

Otherwise, if you are going **desktop-first** you are going to be using a lot of **max-width**.
